# Express API for Payment Handling

This API allows you to handle payments using the Express framework in Node.js. It facilitates processing coral-commerce payments through an external service and handling the response accordingly.

## Installation

To install and run this API locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tushii05/coral-commerce.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

## Usage

To use this API, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Start the server by running:

```bash
node server.js
```

This will start the server on port 3000 by default. You can modify the port in the `server.js` file if needed.

2. Make POST requests to the `/handle-payment` endpoint with the required payload:

```javascript
POST /handle-payment
{
    "description": "Product Description",
    "price": 10.99
}
```

Ensure that you provide a JSON payload with a description and price for the product.

3. Handle the response from the server:

- If the payment is successful, you will be redirected to the provided Redirect URL.
- If there's an error processing the payment, an appropriate error message will be returned.
